# TrendTestSimulations
R-code developed for my master thesis, "Test for trends in recurrent events data".



- [Process_Simulating.R](/Process_Simulating.R) - Contains the different processes (HPP, NHPP Inversion, NHPP Thinning, Gamma RP, Gamma TRP, and Weibull TRP) for both failure and time truncated processes.
- [Trend_Tests_Codes.R](/Trend_Tests_Codes.R) - Defines the tests (Laplace, Military Handbook, Lewis-Robinson, Mann-Kendall, and Anderson-Darling type).
- [Trend_Simulating.R](/Trend_Simulating.R) - Simulates the processes to see how the different tests react.
- [Real_Data_Testing.R](/Real_Data_Testing.R) - Analyses USSH and LHD data, calculating test statistic values and p-values.
